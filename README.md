# 📈 Algorithmic Trading Strategy: Momentum-Based Backtesting Engine

This repository showcases a prototype algorithmic trading engine that identifies and backtests momentum-based strategies on U.S. equity market data. Designed as part of my self-driven learning in quantitative finance, the project reflects my interest in applying data science and machine learning to real-world trading problems.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Identify high-performing stocks using momentum indicators (RSI, SMA crossovers)
- Automate strategy generation and evaluation over historical periods
- Visualize key metrics (cumulative returns, drawdowns, Sharpe ratios)
- Build an extendable pipeline that can integrate with live trading environments

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- `Python` (data manipulation, modeling)
- `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `TA-Lib`, `yfinance`
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` for data visualization
- `Jupyter Notebook` for prototyping and iteration
- `Git/GitHub` for version control

---

## 📊 Strategy Overview

We tested a **momentum-based strategy** combining:

- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Buy signal under 30, sell over 70
- **Moving Average Crossover**: 10-day vs 50-day
- Optional filters: price volatility, volume threshold

Backtesting logic evaluates:

- Entry/exit logic based on indicator signals
- PnL, win rate, Sharpe Ratio, max drawdown
- Sensitivity across multiple tickers (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, NVDA)

- [performance Dashboard（Plotly）](strategy_performance_dashboard.html)


| Metric         | Value      |
|----------------|------------|
| Total Return   | +24.7%     |
| Sharpe Ratio   | 1.31       |
| Max Drawdown   | -8.4%      |

##  My Role

I independently built the full pipeline, including:

- Strategy design and tuning
- Data sourcing via `yfinance`
- Backtest engine implementation
- Visualization and performance tracking
- README documentation and GitHub publishing

This project was inspired by my experience at HSBC (FX Trading Strategy) and my ongoing Data Science studies at UTS. It's a demonstration of how I bridge theoretical finance with hands-on coding and strategy building.

## Future Plans

- Add live paper trading via Alpaca or IBKR API
- Incorporate ML-based signal generation (XGBoost, LSTM)
- Multi-asset portfolio optimization
